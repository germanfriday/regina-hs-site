			<p class="bodyfont">LOOKING TO REDUCE THE COST OF YOUR TUITION? </p>
						</b>
		<p class="bodyfont">If so, and you are going to purchase groceries in 
		the next week, fill up your car with gas, or purchase gift cards to give 
		as gifts, then SCRIP is a great way for you to lower your tuition costs!
		</p>
		<b>
				<p class="bodyfont">SCRIP is a brilliant fund raising program 
				that allows you to earn tuition credit without costing you one 
				penny more that you are already spending!! </p>
		<p class="bodyfont">SCRIP IS “REAL” MONEY –
						</b>When you purchase SCRIP, you are purchasing actual 
		gift cards that are used just like cash. </p>
		<b>
				<p class="bodyfont">SCRIP PAYS –
						</b>Gift cards are purchased at a discounted rate by De 
				La Salle SCRIP (for Regina families). 75% of that discount 
				(varies per vendor) is later realized as your “profit” when sold 
				to you at face value. That’s it! A dollar-per-dollar exchange!
		</p>
		<b>
				<p class="bodyfont">FAMILIES LOVE THE TUITION SAVINGS –
						</b>Participating families regularly earn hundreds of 
				dollars off of their tuition each year with very little effort. 
				Some families earn <b>$1,000</b> or more in one year! It’s just 
				a matter of changing your thought pattern. Make your money work 
				for you! </p>
		<b>
				<p class="bodyfont">THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO SAVE –
						</b>Groceries: Kroger, Nino’s, Sam’s, Randazzo’s, and 
				Vince &amp; Joe’s. Department Stores: JC Penney, Kohl’s, Kmart and 
				Wal-Mart. Gas: Sunoco, Mobil, Speedway, and BP. Restaurants 
				Galore RX: CVS, Walgreen’s, and Rite Aid. Specialty Stores, 
				Entertainment, and Services. There are hundreds of vendors to 
				choose from! </p>
		<p class="bodyfont"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">*** Please 
		Note: You MUST enroll with SCRIP to participate in Kroger Community 
		Rewards. Please complete, sign and turn in the SCRIP Enrollment/Release
