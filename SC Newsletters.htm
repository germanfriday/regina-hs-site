			<blockquote>
				<h3 class="bodyfont">On behalf of the Regina High School Sports 
				Club, I would like to thank everyone who sacrificed their time 
				and energy in support of the Lemon Chill.&nbsp; This annual 
				fundraiser is a huge project for us.&nbsp; Without the 
				participation of the students, parents and friends of Regina 
				High school, we could not have done it. We netted over $18,000 
				for our athletic program.&nbsp; Thank you to the Davis family of 
				Prairie Farms Dairy for their faith and support.&nbsp; We'll see 
				you all next year.

				<h3><font color="#001A66">3-5 Year Development Plan - </font>
				</h3>
				<p class="bodyfont">The SPOrTS Club has formed a sub-committee to 
				establish a 3 to 5 year plan for athletic facilities at Regina's 
				new location.&nbsp; The committee was established to provide a 
				planning group for how best to develop available space for use 
				by Regina's athletic teams.&nbsp; The kick-off meeting was held 
				Wednesday, October 11, 2006 with a second meeting on October 24.&nbsp; 
				The committed set goals, objectives, and action items, and is 
				proceeding to develop a plan.&nbsp; The goal is to have a 
				prioritized development schedule by the end of the year.</p>
				<h3><font color="#001A66">Laffey Inducted - </font></h3>
				<p class="bodyfont">October 30, 2006 was another momentous moment for Regina's Diane 
				Laffey as she was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of 
				Fame.&nbsp; Diane is ranked first in the state for career 
				softball victories (907) and fourth for career girls basketball 
				victories (539).&nbsp; Present were members of the Regina school 
				staff, her close friends, members of the Regina SPOrTS Club, and 
				past graduates.&nbsp; Diane provided an acceptance speech that 
				set the tone for the entire evening.&nbsp; She credited her 
				success to being blessed with, and surrounded by great talent 
				and support on and off the field and court.&nbsp; Host Frank 
				Beckman introduced Diane to lead off the program which included 
				inductees Jimmy Devellano, Dave Diles, Sonny Grandelius, Greg 
				Kelser, Dan Majerle, Jack McCloskey, and Frank Tanana.&nbsp; 
				Diane's record definitely puts her in position to lead that 
				all-star cast. Well deserved Diane.</p>
